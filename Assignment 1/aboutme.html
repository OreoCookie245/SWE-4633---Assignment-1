        <p>
            My name is Sara Racel and I'm a senior at Kennesaw State University. Currently I'm double
            majoring in Software Engineering and Game Design and Development. This website was created
            for my SWE 4633 course, which is Cloud Software Development. 
        </p>

            Outside of school I enjoy playing games like Grounded, Minecraft, Lethal Companay, and Peak.
            I also love baking, reading, and spending time with my cats.
